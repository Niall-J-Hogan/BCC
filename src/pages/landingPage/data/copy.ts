export const byTattoers = `Seven Hills is a new tattoo convention run by artists who want to honour the traditions of the trade in their own way, in their own city.\n\nOur approach to achieving this starts with the artists themselves. As a tattooer-run festival, we understand the importance of bringing an array of artists from around the UK and beyond who all specialise in a variety of styles. We’ll have world-renowned artists rubbing shoulders with promising young artists in an event that celebrates the history of the trade and its future.`;

export const whenIsIt = `Seven Hills Tattoo Convention will take place in Sheffield on 31st of October until the 1st of September 2024. We’re looking to create a unique, inclusive and diverse convention experience that combines everything that we love about tattooing. A good tattoo convention for the people who love the artform, by tattooers themselves.\n\n Seven Hills is a truly one of a kind event in Sheffield, bringing you the most talented and innovative artists out there. All in one place. All in the land of The Seven Hills.`;

export const theVenue = `Ask any Sheffield native about their city’s history, and I guarantee you’ll hear the word: ‘pride’.  Seven Hills will take place in Kelham Island museum - the iconic and historical heart of Sheffield’s storied history as the Steel City.\n\n This venue itself sits on a man-made island that’s over 900 years old. You can feel the history in the surrounding area, but the museum itself is much more than a tribute to Sheffield’s heritage- It’s a versatile venue used for a wide range of events and, come September 2024, a tattoo convention for the first time.`;
export const theVendors = `We’ll also be inviting a selection of local independent vendors from around the UK to join us at Seven Hills. You’ll be able to browse what other creatives in the local area have been busy crafting, building, or designing, giving you a chance to come home with something else other than a freshly-wrapped tatt.\n\n\We’ve also made sure to have local food vendors on-site, catering to all dietary requirements, and ready to keep you fuelled for the day.`;
