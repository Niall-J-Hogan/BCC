And it’s our team that makes this possible. \n\n Our team will be on hand to help with anything you might need. Need a hand taking your gear to your booth? No problem. Need a few different sizes of stencil? We’ve got a whole team for that. Or maybe you’re just looking for somewhere to go after the convention? We got you. \n\n One thing we kept hearing from artists and attendees last year was how great our team was. We’ll do everything we can to help you out over the weekend.`;
export const theVenue = `Ask any Sheffield native about their city’s history, and I guarantee you’ll hear the word:‘pride’. Seven Hills will take place in Kelham Island museum - the iconic and historical heart of Sheffield’s storied history as the Steel City\n\nWith a pub and cafe both in the same grounds as the venue, there’s plenty of options to keep you fed and watered the whole weekend.`;

export const theVendors = `We’ll also be inviting a selection of local independent vendors from around the UK to join us at Seven Hills. You’ll be able to browse what other creatives in the local area have been busy crafting, building, or designing, giving you a chance to come home with something else other than a freshly-wrapped tatt. In 2024, we had vintage clothing, woodcuts, handmade painted signs and much more on offer.\n\n\Last year we had the teams from Talon and Pina collaborating on some unreal tacos, as well as the best artisan doughnuts in the area from the guys at Doughnotts.`;
